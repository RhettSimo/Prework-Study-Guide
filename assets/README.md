# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is a guide to keep notes when I was going through the prework in the Coding Bootcamp. It gives me a resource to keep going back to if I forget something and need to come back to it. It taught me patience (especially), and how to implement code (in a simple, albeit basic) form in a website.
